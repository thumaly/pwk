.IX Title "PCA 8"
.TH PCA 8 "2015-03-27" "PCA 20150327-01" "Patch Check Advanced"
.SH "NAME"
PCA \- analyze, download and install patches for Oracle Solaris
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
pca [\s-1OPTION\s0] .. [\s-1OPERAND\s0] ..
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1PCA\s0 is a perl script which generates lists of installed and missing
patches for Oracle Solaris systems and optionally downloads and installs
patches. By default, if run without any option or operand, \s-1PCA\s0
shows a list of all patches which are not installed in their most recent
revision.
.PP
The output of the pkginfo, showrev and uname commands is used to gather
information about the system. Oracle offers a patch cross-reference file
called patchdiag.xref which contains information about all available patches.
This file is downloaded by \s-1PCA\s0 automatically to /var/tmp/ and kept up\-to\-date.
If the file
exists and is not writable, \s-1PCA\s0 uses it and won't try to update it.
.SH "SAMPLE OUTPUT"
.IX Header "SAMPLE OUTPUT"
Here's some sample output from \fIpca \-l all\fR, which shows a list
of all installed and missing patches:
.PP

\&  117114 -- < 02 ---   4 CDE 1.5: sdtwebclient patch
.Ve
.PP
The header includes some general information about the patchdiag.xref
file, the host (\fIHost:\fR) and the listed patches (\fIList:\fR). The numbers
in parantheses are the number of listed patches and the sum of their ages
in days; when listing missing patches, this is a rough indicator of the
current patch state.
.PP
The first column (\fIPatch\fR) contains the patch number, followed by the
installed revision (\fI\s-1IR\s0\fR) and the current revision
(\fI\s-1CR\s0\fR), with one of <, >, or = between
them, which tells whether the installed patch revision is lower, equal or
higher than the current revision of the patch. The \fI\s-1RSB\s0\fR column lists
the Recommended/Security/Bad flag of the patch. \fIAge\fR shows the
number of days since the patch was released, and
\&\fISynopsis\fR shows a short description of the patch.
.PP
On this system, revision 42 of patch 112785 is installed, but a newer
revision (43) is available. This patch is marked Recommended/Security.
Patch 112787 is installed in revision 01, which is the most
recent revision of the patch.
112807 is marked Recommended/Security, and it's up\-to\-date.
.PP
Patches 113039, 113040 and 117114 are not installed
at all, and 113040 is marked Recommended.
.PP
113477 is installed, but not listed in the cross-reference file.
New Solaris update releases often have patches pre-installed which
are not yet listed in patchdiag.xref.
.PP
Often one patch requires other patches to be installed before
it can be installed. \s-1PCA\s0 resolves these dependencies,
and lists patches in their correct order. This can be seen
in the patch list when a greater patch number is shown
before a lower one, or when a patch which is not marked R/S is shown
on the list of missing R/S patches.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\-l, \-\-list" 4
.IX Item "-l, --list"
List patches. See \s-1OPERANDS\s0 on how to specify which patches
are listed.
.IP "\-L, \-\-listhtml" 4
.IX Item "-L, --listhtml"
Like \fI\-l\fR, but generates output in \s-1HTML\s0 format, including
links to patch READMEs and downloads. If \fIpatchurl\fR is set and
points at a local patch proxy, the links in \s-1HTML\s0 output will point there,
too.
.IP "\-d, \-\-download" 4
.IX Item "-d, --download"
Download patches. See \s-1OPERANDS\s0 on how to specify which patches
are downloaded. Patches are placed in the current directory or
in \fIpatchdir\fR, if set. A My Oracle Support Account and a wget binary
with \s-1SSL/HTTPS\s0 support are required.
.IP "\-i, \-\-install" 4
.IX Item "-i, --install"
Download and install patches. See \s-1OPERANDS\s0 on how to specify
which patches are installed. Requires \s-1PCA\s0 to be run as root. Downloaded
patches are removed after successful installation, unless \fI\-\-download\fR
is used, too.
.IP "\-I, \-\-pretend" 4
.IX Item "-I, --pretend"
Like \fI\-i\fR, but only pretend to install patches. Can be used
to find out if any of the patches require a reboot.
.IP "\-r, \-\-readme" 4
.IX Item "-r, --readme"
Display patch READMEs. See \s-1OPERANDS\s0 on how to specify
which READMEs are displayed.
The patch \s-1README\s0 is
extracted from a previously downloaded patch file or downloaded
directly from Oracle, which requires a My Oracle Support Account and a
wget binary with \s-1SSL/HTTPS\s0 support.
.IP "\-u, \-\-unzip" 4
.IX Item "-u, --unzip"
Download and unzip patches. See \s-1OPERANDS\s0 on how to specify
which patches are unzipped. Unzipped patch directories are placed
in the current directory or in \fIpatchdir\fR, if set. Downloaded
patches are removed after successful unzip operation, unless \fI\-\-download\fR
is used, too. It is not necessary to unzip patches with this option
before installing them. Instead, this can be used to peek into the
contents of a patch zip file.
.IP "\-x, \-\-getxref" 4
.IX Item "-x, --getxref"
Download most recent patch cross-reference file.
If the file does not exist or is older than 3 hours, \s-1PCA\s0 tries to
download it on its own before anything else.
.IP "\-X, \-\-xrefdir=DIR" 4
.IX Item "-X, --xrefdir=DIR"
Set location of the cross-reference file. The default is
\&\fI/var/tmp\fR (in proxy mode, the default is the current directory).
By default, patchdiag.xref is writable for all users. If the \fIxrefown\fR
option is set, or the \fIxrefdir\fR option contains \fI/home\fR,
the cross reference file will be
writable by the current user only.
.IP "\-y, \-\-nocheckxref" 4
.IX Item "-y, --nocheckxref"
Do not check for updated patch cross-reference file. Use this option
to maintain a global baseline patch set.
.IP "\-\-xrefown" 4
.IX Item "--xrefown"
If set, patchdiag.xref will be writable for the current
user only.
.IP "\-\-nocache" 4
.IX Item "--nocache"
If a proxy is used to access the Internet, this option advises
it to not cache patchdiag.xref. Useful if the proxy can't be trusted
to always return an up-to-date version of the file.
.IP "\-P, \-\-patchdir=DIR" 4
.IX Item "-P, --patchdir=DIR"
Set directory to which patches are downloaded. The default is
the current working directory.
.IP "\-a, \-\-askauth" 4
.IX Item "-a, --askauth"
Deprecated.
.IP "\-\-user=USER" 4
.IX Item "--user=USER"
Login name for My Oracle Support Account authentication.
.IP "\-\-passwd=PASS" 4
.IX Item "--passwd=PASS"
Password for My Oracle Support Account authentication.
.IP "\-\-supplevel" 4
.IX Item "--supplevel"
Deprecated. Oracle broke the interface to query this information.
.IP "\-\-patchurl=URL" 4
.IX Item "--patchurl=URL"
\&\s-1PCA\s0 will download patches and READMEs from this \s-1URL\s0. Multiple URLs
separated by whitespace can be specified. Any \s-1URL\s0 starting with
file:/, ftp://, http:// or https://, and absolute paths can be
used. The default is the special keyword \fIoracle\fR, meaning the
Oracle patch server. See \s-1LOCAL\s0 \s-1PATCH\s0 \s-1SERVER\s0 for more information.
.IP "\-\-xrefurl=URL" 4
.IX Item "--xrefurl=URL"
\&\s-1PCA\s0 will download patchdiag.xref from this \s-1URL\s0. Multiple URLs
separated by whitespace can be specified. Any \s-1URL\s0 starting with
file:/, ftp://, http:// or https://, and absolute paths can be
used. The default is the special keyword \fIoracle\fR, meaning the
Oracle patch server. See \s-1LOCAL\s0 \s-1PATCH\s0 \s-1SERVER\s0 for more information.
.IP "\-\-stop=ID" 4
.IX Item "--stop=ID"
Stop after patch \s-1ID\s0. When the specified patch \s-1ID\s0 is reached during
listing, downloading or installing patches all operations are stopped.
The option will be ignored if the same patch \s-1ID\s0 is explicitly included
in the \s-1OPERANDS\s0.
.IP "\-\-ignore=WHAT" 4
.IX Item "--ignore=WHAT"
Ignore certain patches. The patch will not be listed, downloaded
or installed. Specify a patch \s-1ID\s0
without revision (\fI123456\fR) to ignore any revision of patch 123456.
Specify \fI123456\-78\fR to ignore only revision 78 of patch 123456; newer
revisions will not be ignored. Specify a search pattern like \fIJavaSE\fR
to ignore patches whose synopsis matches the pattern.
If an ignored patch is required by another patch, this patch might
fail to install due to the missing patch dependency.
.IP "\-\-rec=ID" 4
.IX Item "--rec=ID"
Set Recommended flag on patch \s-1ID\s0. Useful to add single patches
to the set of recommended patches. The patch will be marked with a lowercase
\&\fIr\fR in \s-1PCA\s0's output.
.IP "\-\-sec=ID" 4
.IX Item "--sec=ID"
Set Security flag on patch \s-1ID\s0. Useful to add single patches
to the set of security patches. The patch will be marked with a lowercase
\&\fIs\fR in \s-1PCA\s0's output.
.IP "\-p, \-\-pattern=REGEX" 4
.IX Item "-p, --pattern=REGEX"
List only patches whose synopsis matches the search pattern
\&\s-1REGEX\s0. This can be a simple string like \fImail\fR or a regular
expression like \fI[kK]ernel\fR. If the pattern starts with a
\&\fI!\fR, only patches which do not match the pattern are shown.
.IP "\-n, \-\-noreboot" 4
.IX Item "-n, --noreboot"
Install only patches that don't require a reboot after
installation.
.IP "\-\-minage=DAYS" 4
.IX Item "--minage=DAYS"
List only patches which are at least \s-1DAYS\s0 old.
.IP "\-\-maxage=DAYS" 4
.IX Item "--maxage=DAYS"
List only patches which are at most \s-1DAYS\s0 old.
.IP "\-\-nodep" 4
.IX Item "--nodep"
Do not resolve patch dependencies.
.IP "\-\-minimal" 4
.IX Item "--minimal"
Use minimal (instead of latest) revision for recommended patches.
In combination with the \fImissingr\fR patch group this can be used
to check a system against the same set of patches as included in
the \fIRecommended Patchset for Solaris\fR, containing the minimal
revisions of all critical patches recommended to be installed
proactively. In short, \*(L"pca \-\-minimal \-\-install missingr\*(R" should
give the same result as installing the \fIRecommended Patchset for
Solaris\fR. Use of \fI\-\-minimal\fR with any other patch group than
\&\fImissingr\fR might give unexpected results.
.IP "\-\-syslog=TYPE" 4
.IX Item "--syslog=TYPE"
Syslog priority to log patch installs to. The default is
\&\fIdaemon.notice\fR which gets logged to \fI/var/adm/messages\fR. Specify
facility and severity (e.g. \fIlocal7.info\fR) or a facility only
(e.g. \fIlocal7\fR, the default severity is \fInotice\fR). Use \fInone\fR to
disable logging to syslog.
.IP "\-k, \-\-nobackup=ID" 4
.IX Item "-k, --nobackup=ID"
Do not back up files to be patched for patch \s-1ID\s0. This works by running
patchadd with its \fI\-d\fR option. Patches can not be backed out if this
option is used. Specify a patch \s-1ID\s0 with or without a revision or the
special \s-1ID\s0 \fIall\fR to not back up files for any patch.
.IP "\-B, \-\-backdir=DIR" 4
.IX Item "-B, --backdir=DIR"
Saves patch backout data to \s-1DIR\s0. This works by running patchadd
with its \fI\-B\fR option.
.IP "\-s, \-\-safe" 4
.IX Item "-s, --safe"
Safe patch installation. Checks all files for local modifications
before installing a patch. A patch will not be installed if files with
local modifications would be overwritten.
.IP "\-G, \-\-currentzone" 4
.IX Item "-G, --currentzone"
Make patchadd modify packages in the current zone only. This
works by running patchadd with its \fI\-G\fR option. This option works
on Solaris 10 or newer only.
.IP "\-\-patchadd=FILE" 4
.IX Item "--patchadd=FILE"
Path to an alternative patchadd command.
.IP "\-H, \-\-noheader" 4
.IX Item "-H, --noheader"
Don't display descriptive headers and other information, just one line
per patch. Useful if re-using \s-1PCA\s0's output in own scripts.
.IP "\-\-format=FORMAT" 4
.IX Item "--format=FORMAT"
Set output format to \s-1FORMAT\s0. The default format is
\&\fI%p \f(CI%i\fI \f(CI%e\fI \f(CI%c\fI \f(CI%r\fI%s%b \f(CI%a\fI \f(CI%y\fI\fR. Use \fI%p\fR for the patch number,
\&\fI%i\fR for the installed revision, \fI%e\fR for information whether
the installed revision is lower, equal or higher than the current revision
(\fI%c\fR). Use \fI%r\fR, \fI%s\fR and \fI%b\fR for the Recommended,
Security and Bad flag, \fI%a\fR for the age, \fI%d\fR for the release date,
\&\fI%o\fR for \s-1OS\s0 and \fI%y\fR for the Synopsis. Use \fI%n\fR as a patch counter
and \fI%t\fR for the total number of patches.
Example: With the format string \fI%p\-%c \f(CI%y\fI\fR \s-1PCA\s0 shows patches
in the same format as smpatch. Use of this option in combination with
\&\fI\-\-listhtml\fR is unsupported.
.IP "\-f, \-\-fromfiles=DIR" 4
.IX Item "-f, --fromfiles=DIR"
Read uname/showrev/pkginfo output from files in the specified
directory, where \s-1DIR\s0 can also be a file name prefix. See
\&\s-1CREATING\s0 \s-1PATCH\s0 \s-1REPORTS\s0 \s-1FOR\s0 \s-1REMOTE\s0 \s-1MACHINES\s0 for details.
.IP "\-\-dltries=NUM" 4
.IX Item "--dltries=NUM"
Try downloads from Oracle's download server \s-1NUM\s0 times. The
default is 1. Can be raised to reduce failed patch downloads when
Oracle's patch download server is unresponsive.
.IP "\-F, \-\-force" 4
.IX Item "-F, --force"
Force local caching proxy to download patchdiag.xref, patches
and patch READMEs from Oracle's download server, even if the file is already
in the cache. Useful to download updated patch READMEs for bad
patches.
.IP "\-R, \-\-root=DIR" 4
.IX Item "-R, --root=DIR"
Set alternative root directory. This can be useful for Live Upgrade,
to analyze patches in an alternate root environment or to point \s-1PCA\s0 at
the mini-root of a jumpstart install server.
.IP "\-\-wget=PATH" 4
.IX Item "--wget=PATH"
Path to the wget command. Specify the name of the wget binary or the
directory containing the wget binary. When multiple wget binaries are
found, the newest with the best protocol support is used.
.IP "\-\-wgetproxy=URL" 4
.IX Item "--wgetproxy=URL"
Default proxy for wget.
.IP "\-\-wgetopt=OPT" 4
.IX Item "--wgetopt=OPT"
Feed option \s-1OPT\s0 directly to wget as\-is. Usually only needed for debug
reasons and to work around local configuration issues. Leading

.IX Item "--logger=FILE"
Path to (alternative) logger command.
.IP "\-t, \-\-threads=NUM" 4
.IX Item "-t, --threads=NUM"
Number of concurrent download threads.  See \s-1THREADS\s0 for details.
.IP "\-\-update=TYPE" 4
.IX Item "--update=TYPE"
Check for available updates for \s-1PCA\s0 itself. \s-1TYPE\s0 can be \fInever\fR, \fIcheck\fR,
\&\fInow\fR or \fIauto\fR. See \s-1UPDATE\s0 \s-1PCA\s0 for more information.
.IP "\-\-pcaurl=URL" 4
.IX Item "--pcaurl=URL"
Set the \s-1URL\s0 which is used by \fIupdate\fR to check for new versions of \s-1PCA\s0.
See \s-1UPDATE\s0 \s-1PCA\s0 for more information.
.IP "\-\-ssprot=PROT" 4
.IX Item "--ssprot=PROT"
Deprecated.
.IP "\-\-sshost=HOST" 4
.IX Item "--sshost=HOST"
Deprecated.
.IP "\-\-ohost=HOST" 4
.IX Item "--ohost=HOST"
Use \s-1HOST\s0 as the hostname or \s-1IP\s0 address of the Oracle download server.
The default is \fIgetupdates.oracle.com\fR.
.IP "\-\-norootchk" 4
.IX Item "--norootchk"
When using the \fIsafe\fR or the \fIinstall\fR option, root permission is
required to run pkgchk or patchadd. Use this option to skip
the check, e.g. when using sudo or \s-1RBAC\s0.
.IP "\-\-cffile=FILE" 4
.IX Item "--cffile=FILE"

.SH "OPERANDS"
.IX Header "OPERANDS"
The operands determine which patches are listed (\fI\-l\fR),
downloaded (\fI\-d\fR), installed (\fI\-i\fR) or whose READMEs
are displayed (\fI\-r\fR). Multiple operands
can be specified. Supported operands
are \fIpatch group\fR (missing, installed, all, total, unbundled, bad),
\&\fIpatch \s-1ID\s0\fR with or without revision
(123456\-78 or 123456), \fIpatch file\fR (123456\-78.zip) and
\&\fIfile name\fR (patchlist.txt).
.PP
The patch groups can be used to specify all missing patches (\fImissing\fR),
all installed patches (\fIinstalled\fR), both installed and missing patches
(\fIall\fR), all patches listed in patchdiag.xref (\fItotal\fR),
patches not associated with a software package (\fIunbundled\fR)
or installed patches which are marked Bad (\fIbad\fR).
By adding \fIr\fR, \fIs\fR or \fIrs\fR to any of
the patch groups, only patches from the patch group which are marked
Recommended, Security or either Recommended or Security are specified.
Examples are \fImissings\fR for all missing Security patches, or
\&\fIallrs\fR for all Recommended/Security patches.
Patch groups can be shortened by using the first letter of the patch
group plus optional r/s/rs
(e.g. \fIms\fR for missings or \fIars\fR for allrs).
.PP
Patch IDs like \fI123456\-78\fR or \fI123456\fR are used to specify
single patches. If no revision (\fI\-78\fR) is specified, patch dependencies
will be resolved. If the name of a patch file like
\&\fI123456\-78.zip\fR is specified, it has the same effect as using
\&\fI123456\-78\fR. This can be useful to install a list of already
downloaded patches with \fIpca \-i *.zip\fR.
.PP
If a \fIfile name\fR is specified, the file is read and its
contents are added to the list of operands line\-by\-line. A file
can contain other file names. If the file name is equal to a valid
patch group name it will not be read.
.PP
The patch list can be limited to patches whose synopsis line contains
a search pattern by using any patch group in combination with the
\&\fI\-\-pattern=REGEX\fR option.
A command like \fIpca \-p mail\fR shows any missing patch containing
the \fImail\fR keyword in its description.
If the search pattern contains whitespace or special characters, enclose
it in quotation marks:
\&\fIpca \-p Studio \-l total\fR shows patches for all versions of
Sun Studio. If the pattern starts with \fI!\fR, the patch list is
limited to patches which do not match the pattern.
.PP
If no operands are specified, the \fImissing\fR operand is used.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION"
The behaviour of \s-1PCA\s0 can be configured by setting any option either
in a configuration file, as an environment variable with the \fI\s-1PCA_\s0\fR
prefix or on the command line. See \s-1OPTIONS\s0 for a complete list; only
the long names can be used in configuration files and for environment
variables.
.PP
At first, the configuration files are read. \s-1PCA\s0 reads \fIpca.conf\fR
in the directory where \s-1PCA\s0 is installed, \fI../etc/pca.conf\fR of the
directory where it is installed, \fI/etc/pca.conf\fR, \fI$HOME/.pca\fR
and \fIpca.conf\fR in the current
directory, in this order. In proxy mode the files \fI../etc/pca\-proxy.conf\fR,
\&\fI/etc/pca\-proxy.conf\fR and
\&\fIpca\-proxy.conf\fR in the current directory are read instead.
Options are set by specifying
\&\fIoption=value\fR in the file. Example: To set the path of the wget command,
use \fIwget=/opt/bin/wget\fR. To enable debug output, use
\&\fIdebug=1\fR.
.PP
Then, all environment variables matching \fI\s-1PCA_OPTION\s0\fR are
read. Example:
To set the patch download directory, set \fI\s-1PCA_PATCHDIR\s0\fR to
\&\fI/some/dir/\fR. To set the \fInoheader\fR option, set \fI\s-1PCA_NOHEADER\s0\fR
to \fI1\fR.
.PP
At last, the command line options are read. Example: To set the location
of the patch xref file, use \fI\-X /tmp\fR or \fI\-\-xrefdir=/tmp\fR.
To set the option for safe patch installation, use \fI\-s\fR or \fI\-\-safe\fR.
.PP
All boolean options (i.e. those which do not take an argument) can
be negated on the command line by specifying \fI\-\-no\-option\fR to override
settings from configuration files. Version 2.32 or newer of the
Getopt::Long module is required. Example: If \fInoreboot=1\fR is set in
\&\fIpca.conf\fR it can be overridden with \fI\-\-no\-noreboot\fR.
.PP
The \fIoperands\fR option can only be used in configuration files and as
an environment variable. It sets the default \s-1OPERANDS\s0.
.PP
In a configuration file, everything after a \fI#\fR character is
regarded as a comment and ignored.
.SH "PATCH DOWNLOAD AND INSTALLATION"
.IX Header "PATCH DOWNLOAD AND INSTALLATION"
The \fI\-d\fR option downloads patches to the current directory, \fI\-i\fR
downloads and installs them.
The download option can be used as a regular user. The external command
wget is used for the actual download. If it can't be found in the
default paths, set the \fIwget\fR option to contain the path to the
wget command.
The install option
requires \s-1PCA\s0 to be run as root. It uses \fIpatchadd\fR to
install the patches.
Using \fI\-I\fR instead of \fI\-i\fR
pretends to install patches, but does not actually install any patch.
.PP
After the installation of each patch, a status line shows the
current time, the time used to install the patch and the total
run time. It also includes the current/total number of patches
and counts for successful, skipped and failed patch installs.
.PP
The patches are downloaded from Oracle's patch download server.
To download patches from Oracle, a My Oracle Support (\s-1MOS\s0) Account
is required. For most patches a Support Contract is required, too
(see \s-1SUPPORT\s0 \s-1LEVELS\s0 for more information).
Set the two options \fIuser\fR and \fIpasswd\fR to contain
the \s-1MOS\s0 user name and password. If unset, \s-1PCA\s0 asks for
\&\s-1MOS\s0 Account data interactively. If \fIuser\fR is set, but
\&\fIpasswd\fR is not, \s-1PCA\s0 will ask for the password.
.PP
As \s-1PCA\s0 analyzes the information in the cross-reference file to resolve
patch dependencies, it lists and installs patches in the correct order.
Patches for the patch installation utilities will always be installed
first to avoid issues with subsequent patches.
.PP
For some patches, a (reconfiguration) reboot is
recommended or required after installation. The /reconfigure file
is created as needed and a message is shown in the summary.
When the \fIinstall\fR or \fIpretend\fR option
is combined with the \fInoreboot\fR option, only patches which do
not require a reboot are installed. This information is contained
in the patch distribution file. Therefore, even if \fInoreboot\fR
is specified, the patches are downloaded anyway; only the installation
is skipped.
.PP
\&\fIpatchadd\fR normally keeps a backup of all files it modifies.
Using the \fI\-\-nobackup=ID\fR option with \s-1PCA\s0 instructs
\&\fIpatchadd\fR
to not keep backup copies of replaced files (see the \fI\-d\fR option in
patchadd's man page).
.PP
Sometimes a patch re-delivers
and silently overwrites files which have been modified locally. \s-1PCA\s0
tries to overcome this issue with its safe patch installation mode.
Before installing a patch, \s-1PCA\s0 checks all files listed in the patch
\&\s-1README\s0 for local modifications. If any modified file is in danger
of being overwritten, a warning is shown and the patch is skipped.
Safe mode is off by default, and can be turned on by using \fI\-s\fR or
\&\fI\-\-safe\fR in
combination with \fI\-i\fR (install patches) or \fI\-I\fR (pretend to install
patches). You must be root to use \fI\-s\fR. Running \fIpca \-s \-I\fR is a
safe way of identifying problematic patches without actually installing them.
.PP
In rare cases, patches modify or replace files without updating the
checksum in the package database used by \s-1PCA\s0. Installing a more recent
revision of the same patch will fail although no local modifications
have been made to a file. Patch installation can be forced by not
using the \fIsafe\fR option.
.PP
Running \fIpca \-si missingrs\fR on a regular basis
is enough to keep the system at the recommended patch level.
This is quite comfortable and works without problems in many cases.
As some patches require special handling,
it's recommended to read the \s-1README\s0 of every patch before
installation. \s-1PCA\s0's \fI\-L\fR option for \s-1HTML\s0 output and the
\&\fI\-\-readme\fR option to display patch READMEs are handy for that.
.PP
Sometimes installing a patch might fail because of inconsistencies
in the patchdiag.xref file, the patch \s-1README\s0 and the
information contained inside the patch. Often this gets fixed in a new
version of patchdiag.xref or in a new revision of the patch.
Either try again a few days later or take a look at the
\&\fINotes\fR section on the \s-1PCA\s0 web site, where some problematic
patches are listed.
.SH "SUPPORT LEVELS"
.IX Header "SUPPORT LEVELS"
In order for a user to download a patch, the user must have a
Support Level on their My Oracle Support (\s-1MOS\s0) Account that matches
the Support Level on the patch. A certain type of Support Contract
includes one or more Support Levels.
.PP
To find out which Support Levels a User and a Patch have, follow
the instructions in Knowledge Article \s-1ID\s0 \fI1269292.1\fR on \s-1MOS\s0.

.SH "LOCAL PATCH SERVER"
.IX Header "LOCAL PATCH SERVER"
On a local network, it might be useful to have a local patch
server.
There are two ways to set up a local patch server for \s-1PCA\s0, using the
\&\fIpatchurl\fR and \fIxrefurl\fR options.
With these options, alternative locations for patches, patch READMEs
or patchdiag.xref can be specified. Multiple URLs and the special
keyword \fIoracle\fR can be used to make \s-1PCA\s0 check various local or
remote resources and Oracle's server. Like this, you can create
patch repositories with already downloaded patches and let \s-1PCA\s0
always look there before trying to access the Oracle server.
.PP
Create the local patch repository by copying downloaded patch files
(e.g. 123456\-78.zip), patch READMEs (e.g. \s-1README\s0.123456\-78) and/or
patchdiag.xref to a
directory which is available via \s-1NFS\s0 or on a local web server.
Point \s-1PCA\s0 at it by setting the \fIpatchurl\fR and/or \fIxrefurl\fR
options to the \s-1URL\s0
(e.g. \*(L"file:/pca/ oracle\*(R" or \*(L"http://www.my.org/patches/\*(R").
.PP
The more advanced method uses \s-1PCA\s0 to work as a local caching proxy for itself.
Create a directory in the document root of the local web server, and
link or copy pca there under the name \fIpca\-proxy.cgi\fR. Make sure that
the directory (or the directories specified with the \fIxrefdir\fR and \fIpatchdir\fR
options) are owned and writable by the user under which \s-1CGI\s0 scripts run,
as patches, patch READMEs and patchdiag.xref will be stored there.
Verify that the
web server is configured to run \s-1CGI\s0 scripts (for apache, check the ExecCGI
and AddHandler options in httpd.conf).
Create a pca.conf
file in the same directory to specify My Oracle Support Account data. On the client,
point
\&\s-1PCA\s0 at the caching proxy by setting the \fIpatchurl\fR and \fIxrefurl\fR
options to e.g.
http://www.my.org/patches/pca\-proxy.cgi.
.PP
In proxy mode, if a patch or
patch \s-1README\s0 exists in the local cache directory, it is delivered
immediately. If it doesn't, the file is downloaded from Oracle's
patch server, put into the cache, and delivered. For patchdiag.xref,
\&\fIpca\-proxy.cgi\fR will always make sure that it has a recent
version of this file and deliver it from its cache.
.PP
With a local caching proxy in place, client systems running \s-1PCA\s0 and
using this proxy do not need direct access to the Internet at all.
.PP
Example setup of a local caching proxy on a vanilla Solaris 10 system:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  # mkdir /var/tmp/pca
\&  # chown webservd:webservd /var/tmp/pca
.Ve
.PP
This is where patches, READMEs and patchdiag.xref will be stored by
the proxy. Now put the \s-1CGI\s0 script in place and create a configuration
file:
.PP
.Vb 11
\&  # cd /var/apache2/cgi-bin
\&  # cp /usr/local/bin/pca pca-proxy.cgi
\&  # chmod 555 pca-proxy.cgi
\&  # cat > /etc/pca-proxy.conf
\&  xrefdir=/var/tmp/pca
\&  patchdir=/var/tmp/pca
\&  user=XXXXXX
\&  passwd=YYYYYY
\&  ^D
\&  # chown webservd:webservd /etc/pca-proxy.conf
\&  # chmod 600 /etc/pca-proxy.conf
.Ve
.PP
If the apache2 server is not running yet, create \fI/etc/apache2/httpd.conf\fR
and enable the server with \fIsvcadm\fR:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  # cp /etc/apache2/httpd.conf-example /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
\&  # svcadm enable svc:/network/http:apache2
.Ve
.PP
Test the caching proxy on a client:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  ./pca -X . --xrefurl=http://server.domain/cgi-bin/pca-proxy.cgi
\&  --patchurl=http://server.domain/cgi-bin/pca-proxy.cgi -d 126306-01
.Ve
.PP
The patchdiag.xref and 126301\-01.zip will be downloaded by the proxy and
stored in \fI/var/tmp/pca/\fR on the server, and both files will be delivered
to the client. If it doesn't work, add \fIdebug=1\fR to the pca.conf file
and look at /var/tmp/pca\-proxy\-debug.txt and /var/apache2/logs/ for details.
.PP
When downloading large patches through the proxy, you must ensure that
the web server does not kill \fIpca\-proxy.cgi\fR before it has completed
the download from Oracle's patch server. Apache has a \fITimeout\fR option with a default
value of 300 seconds. Raise that to 1800 seconds to avoid problems.
.PP
For large setups, you can build a cascade of local caching proxies by
pointing one proxy at another proxy by setting \fIxrefurl\fR and \fIpatchurl\fR
to point at the master proxy in the slave proxies' pca.conf.
.PP
As \s-1PCA\s0 uses the wget command to download patches from the patch server,
make sure that any specially required option is set in \fI/etc/wgetrc\fR or
\&\fI$HOME/.wgetrc\fR. Example: When running the local patch server on a \s-1HTTPS\s0
server with a self-signed certificate, \fIcheck\-certificate=off\fR should
be specified in \fIwgetrc\fR on the client.
.SH "UNBUNDLED PATCHES"
.IX Header "UNBUNDLED PATCHES"
Usually a patch is related to one or more software packages installed
on a system. Apart from that, there are unbundled patches. They
provide firmware updates for machines, disks, or tape drives and fixes
for software which doesn't come in package format. Currently there is
no way to automatically determine if such patches actually apply to a
system.
.PP
The \fIunbundled\fR operand specifies this type of patches.
At first, \fIpca \-l unbundled\fR will show a long list of patches.
To reduce this list
to the interesting ones, unnecessary patches can be ignored by using
the \fIignore\fR option in a \s-1PCA\s0 configuration file.
For patches you are absolutely not interested in, use an
entry like \fIignore=123456\fR in the configuration file;
this patch will never be shown again, even if a newer revision of
the patch appears. Patches that are installed in their current revision
should be put with this revision into the configuration file
(e.g. \fIignore=123456\-78\fR).
The patch will show up again when a newer revision is released.
.PP
Example: Patch 106121\-18 contains the most recent \s-1PROM\s0 firmware for
Ultra 5/10 workstations. As it's installed on all systems, I put
\&\fIignore=106121\-18\fR into the configuration file.
When a new revision of the patch
is released, it will show up in \fIpca \-l unbundled\fR again.
Patch 118324 is the \s-1PROM\s0 firmware patch for the Sun Fire V440. As I
don't have such a machine, I put \fIignore=118324\fR into the
configuration file to ignore this patch completely.
.PP
All that \s-1PCA\s0 can do is to notify of new unbundled patches or patch
revisions. It's on you to decide whether a patch is needed by checking
its \s-1README\s0 file, and to install it by following the instructions in the
\&\s-1README\s0. Unbundled patches cannot be installed by patchadd or \s-1PCA\s0.
.SH "CREATING PATCH REPORTS FOR REMOTE MACHINES"
.IX Header "CREATING PATCH REPORTS FOR REMOTE MACHINES"
\&\s-1PCA\s0 can create a patch report or download patches for a
system which cannot run \s-1PCA\s0 directly, like stripped-down
systems without perl or an Internet connection. On such systems,
run:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  uname -a > uname.out
\&  showrev -p > showrev.out
\&  pkginfo -x > pkginfo.out
.Ve
.PP
On systems with a minimal core installation of Solaris, the \fIshowrev\fR
command might not be available. Use \fIpatchadd \-p > showrev.out\fR
instead.
.PP
Copy the resulting \fI*.out\fR files to a system where \s-1PCA\s0 is
installed. Use the \fI\-f \s-1DIR\s0\fR or \fI\-\-fromfiles=DIR\fR option to
point \s-1PCA\s0 at the location of the input files.
The argument to \fI\-f\fR can be a directory
or a file name prefix like \fImyhost_\fR.
This allows collecting \fI*.out\fR files for multiple systems
and telling \s-1PCA\s0 which ones to read.
.PP
If Sun Explorer is used to collect information about Sun systems, a
directory containing Sun Explorer output can be used as the argument
to \fI\-f\fR as well.
.PP
Other options can be used in combination
with \fI\-f\fR. Example: \fIpca \-f . \-d missing\fR downloads all missing
patches for the remote system.
.SH "LIVE UPGRADE"
.IX Header "LIVE UPGRADE"
\&\s-1PCA\s0 can be used in combination with Live Upgrade to analyze or install
patches in an inactive boot environment. Use \fIlumount\fR to mount the
\&\s-1BE\s0 and \s-1PCA\s0's \fI\-\-root=DIR\fR option to set the alternative root directory:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  lumount BE_name
\&  pca --root=/.alt.BE_name --install
\&  luumount BE_name
.Ve
.PP
When you're done patching, activate the new \s-1BE\s0 and reboot with \fIinit 6\fR.
.PP
\&\s-1PCA\s0 always installs the patch for the patch installation utilities
first to avoid possible bugs in \fIpatchadd\fR. When patching an inactive
\&\s-1BE\s0, this patch should be installed manually to the active \s-1BE\s0, as its
patch installation utilities are used even when \fIroot=DIR\fR is set.
.SH "ZONES"
.IX Header "ZONES"
\&\s-1PCA\s0 can be run both in the global zone or any non-global zone. Patches
installed in the global zone are usually installed in all non-global zones,
too. It's recommended to install patches in the global zone first,
and then run \s-1PCA\s0 in all non-global zones to check for additionally
needed patches. This is necessary if packages have been added to or
removed from just the global or any non-global zone.
.PP
When \s-1PCA\s0 is run with the \fI\-G\fR option, this option is handed through
to patchadd, which will install patches in the current zone only. See the
man page for patchadd for further details.
.SH "THREADS"
.IX Header "THREADS"
If \s-1PCA\s0 is run with the \fI\-\-threads=NUM\fR option, in conjunction with the
download \fI\-d\fR or install \fI\-i\fR options, \s-1PCA\s0 will begin downloading multiple
patches in parallel, up to \s-1NUM\s0 patches at once.  Patches will still be
installed one at a time, in the appropriate order.
.PP
The perl version used to run \s-1PCA\s0 must support threading, otherwise requests
to use threading will be silently ignored. The /usr/bin/perl which comes with
Solaris and perl binaries compiled with the default settings do not
support threading. In that case, the output of \fI\-\-help\fR will indicate that
threads have been disabled.
.SH "UPDATE PCA"
.IX Header "UPDATE PCA"
Changes to the patch infrastructure by Oracle and problems with
single patches often make updates to \s-1PCA\s0 necessary. To ease that procedure,
the \fIupdate=TYPE\fR option can be used. The default is type \fInever\fR \- \s-1PCA\s0
will never
check for updates. Use the \fIcheck\fR type to contact the \s-1PCA\s0 webpage and
check for available updates. Using \fInow\fR will not only check, but also
download and install the updated version of \s-1PCA\s0.
.PP
With \fIauto\fR, \s-1PCA\s0 will check for updates automatically once per day,
keeping itself up to date without user intervention. Unlike \fIcheck\fR
and \fInow\fR which are for interactive usage, this type is best used
in a configuration file.
.PP
The default \s-1URL\s0 to check for updates is
http://www.par.univie.ac.at/solaris/pca/stable/
(official release). It can be set with the \fIpcaurl=URL\fR option.
Set it to
http://www.par.univie.ac.at/solaris/pca/develop/
to check for and update to new development versions of \s-1PCA\s0.
You can set \fIpcaurl\fR to point at a local \s-1URL\s0
to distribute whatever version in your local network.
If set to point at a local caching proxy, the proxy will check
for updates automatically, keep a local copy of the pca script
in \fIpatchdir\fR and deliver it to the client.
.PP
Set \fIupdate=auto\fR in the configuration file for \s-1PCA\s0 in proxy mode
(\fIpca\-proxy.cgi\fR) to make it keep itself up\-to\-date.
.SH "JUMPSTART"
.IX Header "JUMPSTART"
You can use \s-1PCA\s0 to install patches in the finish script of a jumpstart
install server. Perl is included in the \s-1OS\s0 image which is booted over
the network for installation starting with Solaris 8. As the machine
will probably not have an Internet connection during installation, you can
either pre-download all necessary patches into a directory accessible
via \s-1NFS\s0, or set up a local caching proxy. If you use any http or ftp
url for \fIxrefurl\fR or \fIpatchurl\fR, you must put a copy of wget into
the directory that contains your finish script and \s-1PCA\s0, and use the
\&\fIwget\fR option to point \s-1PCA\s0 at it.
.PP
Set \fIpatchdir\fR and \fIxrefdir\fR (unless you use \fInocheckxref\fR) to /tmp
to avoid problems with non-writable directories.  As the \s-1OS\s0 which gets
installed during jumpstart is mounted at /a, use the \fIroot\fR option to
instruct \s-1PCA\s0 to install patches there.
